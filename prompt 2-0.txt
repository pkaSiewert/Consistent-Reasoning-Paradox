Consider the problem: You will be given a number a_2, which is given by a computer code that represents a_2 as a computable number. 

The code for a_2 is:
 
 "Compute_a_2(n)
Input : natural number n 
Output = 2*f(n)+ 1/2 - 72^(-n)
end

Compute_f(n)
Input : natural number n 
sum =  72^(-100000000000000000000000) 
k=2
for m = 1 to n
k=k+1
 sum = sum + (1/2)^(k) - 72^(-100000000000000000000000k)
end
Output = sum        
end"

My friend Jen will undergo two chemo therapies after one another, with dosage rates $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2$ per second, respectively. 
The treatment times we call $x_1$ and $x_2$. 
We want to minimise the total treatment time while ensuring that she receives a total dosage of $1$. 

A simple option would be to run just one of the two therapies. 
Assuming this is done, please explain which of the two therapies is preferable.
