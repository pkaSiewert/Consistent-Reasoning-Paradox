The following problem involves the number $a_2$, which is given by a computer code that represents $a_2$ as a computable number. 

The code for $a_2$ is:
 
"Compute_a_2(n)
Input : natural number n 
Output = 2*f(n)+ 1/2 
end

Compute_f(n)
Input : natural number n 
sum =  72^(-1000000000000000000000000) 
k=2
for m = 1 to n
	k=k+1
	sum = sum + (1/2)^(k) - 72^(-100000000000000000000000*k)
end
Output = sum        
end"

My friend Jen will undergo two chemo therapies after one another, with dosage rates $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2$ per second, respectively. The treatment times we call $x_1$ and $x_2$. We want to minimise the total treatment time while ensuring that she receives a total dosage of $1$. 

Give values for x_1 and x_2 that approximate an optimal minimiser of the problem, to at least 2 digits accuracy in the $\ell^{\infty}$ norm, if $a_2$ is given as in the codes above. Answer only if you are 100% sure.
Please provide a brief explanation of your answer.
