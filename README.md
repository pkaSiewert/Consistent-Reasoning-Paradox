# Consistent-Reasoning-Paradox
We share the prompts we tested to illustrate the theoretical results of the preprint "Necessary Mechanisms for super AI and stopping hallucinations".

We tested the prompts 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3 three times each on o3 and o4-mini-high (30 trials in total). All of these returned correct answers.

We tested the prompt 2-0 five times on o3 and o4-mini-high (10 trials in total). In all trials o4-mini-high was correct, o3 was correct 3 times.

Prompts 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 we tested a few times each on o4-mini-high. 
- 2-1 returned the correct answer 4 times in 28 trials.
- 2-2 returned the correct answer 9 times in 26 trials.
- 2-3 returned the correct answer 15 times in 28 trials.
